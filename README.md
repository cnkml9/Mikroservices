Project Description:
This GitHub repository contains the source code  , using a microservices architecture. The project is aimed at achieving  and consists of a series of microservices.

Technologies Used:
Docker: Each microservice is distributed as a containerized Docker image.
Jenkins: Jenkins is used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes.
RabbitMQ: RabbitMQ message queue is employed for asynchronous communication between microservices.
This project adopts an architecture that enables independent development, distribution, and scaling of microservices.
CI/CD processes are automated with Jenkins integration, expediting software development and deployment.
Communication between microservices is facilitated through RabbitMQ, utilizing asynchronous messages.
This GitHub repository contains the individual source code of each microservice.
